Phase 1: Setup and Initialization
Environment Setup

Set up your development environment (IDE, language, libraries).
Initialize a Git repository for version control.
API Key Registration

Sign up for an OpenWeatherMap API key.
Basic Application Structure

Create the basic structure of your application (folders for scripts, tests, configurations, etc.).
================================================================================================================================
Phase 2: Data Retrieval
API Integration

Implement a function to call the OpenWeatherMap API.
Use the API key to retrieve weather data for selected metros in India (Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Kolkata, Hyderabad).
Data Parsing

Parse the response from the API to extract relevant weather parameters: main, temp, feels_like, and dt.
Continuous Data Retrieval

Set up a mechanism (using a loop or scheduler) to fetch data at a configurable interval (e.g., every 5 minutes).
================================================================================================================================
Phase 3: Data Processing
Temperature Conversion

Implement a function to convert temperature values from Kelvin to Celsius (or Fahrenheit based on user preference).
Daily Weather Summary Calculation

Set up data structures (e.g., dictionaries or databases) to store daily weather data.
Implement functions to calculate:
Average temperature
Maximum temperature
Minimum temperature
Dominant weather condition (choose criteria for determining dominance, e.g., most frequent condition).
Storage Solution

Choose a database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL) and set up the schema to store daily summaries.
================================================================================================================================
Phase 4: Alerting System
Threshold Configuration

Implement user-configurable thresholds for temperature and weather conditions.
Threshold Monitoring

Continuously track the latest weather data against the defined thresholds.
Implement logic to trigger alerts when thresholds are breached (e.g., exceed 35Â°C for two consecutive updates).
Alert Notifications

Set up a basic notification system (console output or email alerts).
================================================================================================================================
Phase 5: Visualization and Reporting
Data Visualization

Implement basic visualizations (using libraries like Matplotlib or Plotly) to display:
Daily weather summaries
Historical trends
Triggered alerts
User Interface (Optional)

If time allows, consider creating a simple web interface (using Flask or Django) to display the visualizations.
================================================================================================================================
Phase 6: Testing and Documentation
Test Cases Implementation

Develop unit tests for:
API integration
Data parsing
Temperature conversion
Daily summary calculations
Alerting system
Simulate various weather conditions for thorough testing.
Documentation

Write a comprehensive README file that includes:
Overview of the project
Setup instructions
Design choices and architecture
Dependencies and installation steps (Docker or Podman setup if applicable).
Code Review and Refactoring

Review the code for clarity and maintainability.
Refactor code as needed based on feedback or findings during testing.
================================================================================================================================
Phase 7: Bonus Features (Optional)
Extended Functionality

Explore additional weather parameters (e.g., humidity, wind speed) and incorporate them into rollups/aggregates.
Implement weather forecasts retrieval and summaries based on predicted conditions.
Final Review and Deployment

Conduct final testing and review.
Deploy the application if required (on a cloud platform, local server, etc.)
